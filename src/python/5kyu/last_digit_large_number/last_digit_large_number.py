"""
DESCRIPTION:


Define a function

def last_digit(n1, n2):
  return
that takes in two numbers a and b and returns the last decimal digit of a^b. Note that a and b may be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of 9^7 is 9, since 9^7 = 4782969. The last decimal digit of (2^200)^(2^300), which has over 10^92 decimal digits, is 6.

The inputs to your function will always be non-negative integers.

Examples

last_digit(4, 1)                # returns 4
last_digit(4, 2)                # returns 6
last_digit(9, 7)                # returns 9
last_digit(10, 10 ** 10)        # returns 0
last_digit(2 ** 200, 2 ** 300)  # returns 6
Remarks

JavaScript

Since JavaScript doesn't have native arbitrary large integers, your arguments are going to be strings representing non-negative integers, e.g.

lastDigit("10", "10000000000");
The kata is still as hard as the variants for Haskell or Python, don't worry.

def last_digit(n1, n2):
    if not n1 or not n2:
        return 1
    return int(str(n1 ** (n2 % 4 if n2 % 4 else 4))[-1])


"""
BEST SOLUTION:


def last_digit(n1, n2):
    return pow( n1, n2, 10 )
